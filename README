This is a simple collection of NFC related utilities for reading and writing to a text NFC tag from android.

Some code is from google (android samples) and rest from myself. 

This is suppose to be built as a jar file, so simply run 
$>ant jar

this will built nfcutils.jar and you will need to add a reference to your project. 

See a simple sample project here: https://github.com/cbrulak/Geocoin
